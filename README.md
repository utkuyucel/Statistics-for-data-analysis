# Course Title: Statistics for Data Analysis with Python

**Objective:** This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of statistical concepts and methods used in data analysis, with a focus on Python as the programming language.

**Duration:** 6 months (20 hours per week)

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of Python programming

## Course Outline:

1. Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis
   - [ ] Importance of statistics in data analysis
   - [ ] Types of data: quantitative, qualitative, discrete, continuous
   - [ ] Levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
   - [ ] Data collection methods: surveys, experiments, observational studies

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - [ ] Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
   - [ ] Measures of dispersion: range, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range
   - [ ] Measures of shape: skewness, kurtosis
   - [ ] Exploratory data analysis using Python: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn

3. Probability Theory
   - [ ] Basic probability concepts: sample space, events, probability axioms
   - [ ] Conditional probability and independence
   - [ ] Bayes' theorem
   - [ ] Probability distributions: discrete (binomial, Poisson, geometric) and continuous (uniform, normal, exponential)

4. Inferential Statistics
   - [ ] Sampling and sampling distributions
   - [ ] Central Limit Theorem
   - [ ] Confidence intervals
   - [ ] Hypothesis testing: null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, p-value, Type I and Type II errors
   - [ ] Parametric tests: Z-test, t-test, ANOVA
   - [ ] Non-parametric tests: Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test

5. Regression Analysis
   - [ ] Simple linear regression
   - [ ] Multiple linear regression
   - [ ] Model diagnostics: residuals, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation
   - [ ] Model selection: adjusted R-squared, AIC, BIC
   - [ ] Logistic regression

6. Advanced Statistical Methods
   - [ ] Time series analysis: autoregression, moving average, ARIMA, seasonal decomposition
   - [ ] Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazards model
   - [ ] Multilevel modeling: random intercept, random slope models
   - [ ] Principal component analysis (PCA)
   - [ ] Cluster analysis: k-means, hierarchical clustering

7. Machine Learning and Data Mining
   - [ ] Supervised learning: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks
   - [ ] Unsupervised learning: clustering, dimensionality reduction
   - [ ] Model validation: cross-validation, ROC curve, precision-recall curve
   - [ ] Feature selection and engineering

8. Python Libraries for Advanced Data Analysis
   - [ ] Advanced pandas usage: groupby, merge, pivot, melt
   - [ ] Statsmodels: linear models, time series analysis, generalized linear models
   - [ ] Scikit-learn: preprocessing, model selection, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
   - [ ] TensorFlow and Keras: deep learning and neural networks

9. Communicating Results and Data Visualization
   - [ ] Best practices for data visualization
   - [ ] Advanced matplotlib and seaborn techniques
   - [ ] Interactive data visualization with Plotly and Dash
   - [ ] Reporting results: written reports, presentations, Jupyter notebooks

10. Capstone Project
   - [ ] Identify a real-world data analysis problem
   - [ ] Collect, clean, and preprocess data
   - [ ] Apply statistical methods and machine learning algorithms
   - [ ] Interpret and communicate results

Throughout the course, you'll work on hands-on exercises and real-world projects to gain practical experience and build your data analysis portfolio. Additionally, you'll have access to online resources, video lectures, and discussion forums to support your learning journey.
